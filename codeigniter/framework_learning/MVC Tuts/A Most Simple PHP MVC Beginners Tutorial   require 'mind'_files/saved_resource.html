<p>In SoC point of view, your Controllers are here doing many tasks right now - e.g. they are fetching data from model and then they are also responsible for rendering views right now. So, Controllers here are getting fat and not separated by concern.</p><p>As another note, View in MVC isn't just a dummy template, it's a class of it's own, responsible of fetching data from Model (which MIGHT have been altered by Controller, not necessarily), then decide - based on that data - how to display it. E.g. using templates.</p><p>While this code works and probably is a fast and efficient way to develop things, it's not MVC. It's not bad code, but it's not MVC either.</p>

<p>I'd say you're half right on that one, let me explain why. The controllers are not directly fetching data, the models are. Also, just because the directive for including the view stands right there in the controller does not mean the concerns are not separated.</p><p>At the end of the day, the controller is delegating to some model (as it should, this could be improved but the basic operations are there) and rendering the view, not through a separate class as you mentioned but rather directly because for this example I did not want to clutter my code with useless things. A framework like Rails does a lot of transformation under the hood that I do not need to do here so using a class for that seemed overkill.</p><p>Sure there are a number of ways through which you could improve this, like extracting domain specific objects and having a controller doing 100% delegation.. but once again this lies beyond the scope of this article.</p>

<p>In this example, your controller is fetching the data through a model and then passes it to view. See, it has now two responsibilites which isn't SoC and definitely not mvc. Controller alters the state of the model, view them renders itself based on model. Not based on what controller passes from the model, it renders itself by the state of the model layer. I don't say your example is bad, it's just not MVC.</p>

<p>"it renders itself" haha, yes, by the magician's wand ; ) It is SoC and in that case the controller's responsibility is to organize data and dispatch "actionsactions" to be taken to whatever other structure responsible for it. Saying fetching data through the model and passong it to the view are two responsibilities is like saying rendering the title and rendering the subtitle are two different things... damn, concerns are not separated properly in the view now. By the way, this is all mental masturbation, in the end, do you write good software/apps or not is what matters.</p>

<p>So, if someone disagrees with you, you start removing comments. Cool, man :)</p><p>Here it is, one more time:<br>"Well, Title and subtitle are both view concerns, so it really isn't the same thing. And you know, you can call view class' output methods just like you call controller's action method - outside the MVC triad.</p><p>Controller alters the model, view then renders itself (after your routes.php calls controller's action method) based on whatever model contains. Or by using Observer pattern where Model tells View it has changed. And tadah, there you have a mvc triad with concerns way better separated.</p><p>Don't get offended when people correct some issues rather than just taps your back and says that you rule. And yet again, i am not saying your code is bad (because it works and does what it promises), it just is not MVC."</p>

<p>Actually, Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A...</a> which tells how to utilize/organize resources effectively, while the design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design and it tells how to write code effectively for better maintainability and re-usability. Both are different things and the main motivation behind the MVC is SoC (Separation of Concerns) design principle and hence most of the web frameworks are not 100% MVC (According to some other experts) but I think it's fine if they follow the SoC design principle.</p><p>To be honest, in your example, I can see you didn't follow the SoC design principle and this example is not appropriate for this era of web engineering. Alos, Symfony follows the HMVC (Hierarchical Model View Controller) which is known as component based/modular but still follows the SoC principle.</p><p>You should Google the web for MVC examples/tutorials and Check the Laravel framework if you didn't yet. Btw, your article could lead others to wrong direction.</p>

<p>With all due respect, I think deep reasoning about terms like design/architectural pattern is a terrible rationale. This article is aimed at people having no idea at all of what MVC is or that are struggling with it. Expanding on what you're saying would be like explaining rocket science to a first year engineer student.</p><p>Actually, I did Google for PHP and MVC stuff, only to find out most articles do a great job at spreading complicated terms with complicated examples instead of giving basic explanations on basic stuff.</p><p>Ultimately, if people reading my article end up with a better general idea of the concept then it will be mission accomplished for me and I really don't care if they are wrong using the term "design pattern" instead of "architectural pattern".</p>

<p>I thought the article was clear, simple and easy to follow. Someone who has no knowledge of MVC will get a great start with this post. The over analysis on the pure definition of MVC is over board by some of the posters. If you're working for Google and need to maintain the highest levels of standards in order to provide the most effective code created by man, then have at it. Let the other 99% of the web developers out there putting together sites use the MVC (or any other design pattern) as a loose framework for building their next web application.</p><p>There is always room for improvement, but I could give two $hits if I didn't have the purest pattern. I'm making websites, not space ships.</p>

<p>Clearly written; good flow, from one bit to the next.</p><p>Commenting as one who had <em>"no idea at all of what MVC is"</em>, and as someone who was definitely <em>struggling with it</em> after several articles/introductions, I now have a better understanding of SoC after building a simple application. That was only possible for me by using the example in this tutorial.</p><p>Much appreciation, here.</p>

<p>Heartiest thanks to you friend. Your effort is something I needed very much. Being a Scholar is a different thing. Being a teacher is another. People sometimes get into a habit of looking at the glass from top ( and thus end up yelling the empty part)...;) ...=D..... Thanks for making the world even better. :) It's far better than it has been explained on Symfony's website.</p>

<p>Hi! First of all THANKS. This article is amazing and simple. Except for the PDO part which i don't know yet. (yes, i know. I should study it) <br>Just one question:<br>Reading the comments below i notice that someone says that this approach is not 100% in MVC style. I'm a beginner in MVC and i would like to know who is responsible to inject the model data to the view and reder it? The model itself or the controller? <br>If i didn't misunderstood the MVC logic it should be the controller right? Which delegates the model to fetch data, then the controller inject the fetched data into the view and reders it? Or still better:<br>The controller stores the data into a variable after fetching it and then that variable it will be available to the view that was just required by the controller?</p>

<p>What I have quickly on top of my head:<br>- rework the app so that you have the index in your public folder and only the index, other files should lie elsewhere (probably where they are now is ok)<br>- look into Apache virtualhosts, you'll probably  have to set the DocumentRoot property to point to your public folder, that should be about it</p>

<p>Cheers on the tutorial. Suggestion: could you include some screenshots at the top of what you're building. I know, I know, it's just about learning the MVC design pattern, but it's helpful for some leaners (like me) to see what the final result will produce in order to have a mental framework for what we're creating as we go.</p><p>Thanks again. We need more smart people like you willing to help others.</p>

<p>how do you do to link assets like js or css files into the view using that pattern? Let me explain me, when you're using CodeIgniter framework for example, you need to use a helper like "base_url();" to link the assets onto the html page.</p>

<p>TL;DR Store your css and js assets in an "assets" folder at the root of your project. Put a link to those files in the head part of the layout.</p><p>You refer those files in the layout only. So as usual you put the links to css or js assets in the head part like you would with a vanilla PHP project (which it is, actually). This way there is no need to include different stylesheets for different views for instance, and you are probably better off having only one stylesheet as this will only take one http request and the browser will cache the file for future requests.</p>
